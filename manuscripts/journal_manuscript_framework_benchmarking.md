## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Long-Range Dependence Estimation Challenge**

Long-range dependence (LRD) in time series data represents a fundamental challenge in time series analysis, characterized by persistent autocorrelation that decays slowly over time. The Hurst exponent H quantifies this dependence, where H > 0.5 indicates positive LRD, H < 0.5 indicates negative LRD, and H = 0.5 indicates no LRD. Accurate estimation of H is crucial for understanding complex temporal patterns in diverse applications including:

- **Financial markets**: Volatility clustering and risk assessment
- **Hydrological systems**: River flow patterns and flood prediction
- **Biomedical signals**: Physiological rhythm analysis and artifact detection
- **Climate data**: Temperature patterns and climate change detection

### **1.2 The Confounding Problem**

Despite the importance of LRD estimation, existing estimators face significant challenges under realistic data conditions. Traditional methods such as Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), Rescaled Range (R/S), Higuchi method, Geweke-Porter-Hudak (GPH), and Whittle estimation were designed for idealized data scenarios and often fail when confronted with:

- **Measurement noise**: Environmental and instrumental noise that masks LRD structure
- **Trends**: Long-term systematic changes that can be mistaken for LRD
- **Seasonality**: Periodic variations that interfere with LRD detection
- **Non-stationarity**: Changing statistical properties that violate estimator assumptions

These confounding factors significantly impact the practical utility of LRD estimators in real-world applications, where data is rarely clean and often contains multiple sources of variation.

### **1.3 Research Gap and Motivation**

Current research in LRD estimation lacks systematic approaches to assess estimator robustness and understand quality-performance relationships. Several critical gaps exist:

- **No comprehensive evaluation framework**: Researchers lack standardized methods to assess estimator performance under realistic conditions
- **Quality-blind performance assessment**: Performance metrics don't account for data quality, leading to misleading comparisons
- **Inconsistent evaluation criteria**: Different studies use different evaluation methods, making results incomparable
- **Limited robustness understanding**: No systematic assessment of confounding resistance or failure modes

This research gap significantly hinders the development of more robust LRD estimators and makes it difficult to compare existing approaches fairly.

### **1.4 Contributions**

This work makes several key contributions to the LRD estimation research community:

1. **First integrated quality-performance benchmarking framework**: We develop the first framework that combines quality evaluation with performance benchmarking for LRD estimation
2. **TSGBench adaptation for LRD**: We adapt TSGBench-inspired quality metrics for LRD-specific challenges and domain-specific requirements
3. **Systematic robustness evaluation**: We provide systematic assessment of estimator confounding resistance and failure modes
4. **Quality-performance correlation analysis**: We establish fundamental relationships between data quality and estimator performance
5. **Domain-specific adaptation**: We implement specialized evaluation capabilities for financial, hydrological, biomedical, and climate data

## **2. Related Work**

### **2.1 Long-Range Dependence Estimation**

#### **Traditional Methods**
The field of LRD estimation has evolved significantly since Hurst's original work on the Nile River flow data. Traditional methods include:

- **Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)**: Introduced by Peng et al. (1994), DFA addresses the non-stationarity problem by detrending data at multiple scales before computing fluctuation functions. DFA is widely used due to its robustness to trends and non-stationarity.

- **Rescaled Range (R/S)**: The classic R/S method, developed by Hurst (1951), computes the rescaled range of cumulative deviations from the mean. While conceptually simple, R/S is sensitive to trends and non-stationarity.

- **Higuchi Method**: Higuchi (1988) proposed a method based on the fractal dimension of time series, which is less sensitive to non-stationarity than R/S but can be computationally intensive.

- **Geweke-Porter-Hudak (GPH)**: GPH (1983) developed a semi-parametric approach using the periodogram to estimate the fractional differencing parameter, which is related to the Hurst exponent.

- **Whittle Estimation**: Whittle (1951) proposed a maximum likelihood approach for estimating the fractional differencing parameter, providing optimal statistical properties under Gaussian assumptions.

#### **Recent Advances**
Recent research has focused on addressing the limitations of traditional methods:

- **Wavelet-based methods**: Wavelet analysis provides multi-scale decomposition capabilities that can separate LRD from other components. Methods like wavelet variance and wavelet leaders have shown improved robustness to trends and seasonality.

- **Machine learning approaches**: Recent work has explored using neural networks and other ML methods to estimate LRD, though these approaches often lack interpretability and theoretical foundations.

#### **Current Limitations**
Despite these advances, significant limitations remain:

- **Confounding sensitivity**: Most methods remain sensitive to noise, trends, seasonality, and non-stationarity
- **Parameter sensitivity**: Many methods require careful parameter selection that can significantly impact results
- **Domain limitations**: Methods are not systematically validated across different application domains
- **Robustness unknown**: Limited understanding of how estimators perform under realistic conditions

### **2.2 Quality Evaluation in Time Series**

Traditional data quality assessment focuses on:

- **Completeness**: Missing data assessment and handling
- **Consistency**: Data format and value consistency

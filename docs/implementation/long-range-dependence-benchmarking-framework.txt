Task:

To create a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking framework for detecting and characterising long-range dependence in time series data.

Features:

1. Implement Classical Long-Range-Dependence Estimators: 
	- Temporal: DFA, MFDFA, R/S, Higuchi; 
	- Spectral: Whittle MLE, Periodogram, GPH; 
	- Wavelet: Wavelet Leaders, Wavelet Whittle

2. Statistical Validation:
	- Hypothesis Testing and CI Bootstrapping
	- Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) and Marginal Distribution Testing 
	- Monte Carlo Significance Testing
	- Robustness Testing and Sensitivity Analysis (Heavy-tail fluctuations, non-stationarity, irregular sampling, outliers)
	- Cross Validation Mechanisms

3. Efficiency and Optimisation (JAX and NUMBA):
	- Algorithmic efficiency driven development
	- Parallelisation focus
	- Memory efficiency focus
	- Balanced effective, optimised, efficiency strategy

4. User-Interface and Documentation:
	- Document simple use cases and best practices strategy
	- Document data, analysis, and benchmarking specification
	- Document API usage and examples
	- Document development updates, date, issues, impacts, fixes

5. Extension, Reproducibility, and Utility
	- new algorithmic standards and registration
	- automated synthetic dataset generation
	- new dataset standards and registration
	- automated data processing and standards conformity (ARFIMA, fBm, fGn, fSDE)
	- time series contamination

6. Performance Benchmarking and Summarisation
	- Error/Uncertainty Quantification
	- Accuracy and Efficiency (time and memory)
	- Head-to-head performance comparison
	- Performance Leaderboard
	- Full performance benchmarking analysis

7. Testing, Validation and Maintenance:
	- Test-Driven Development
	- Unit Testing
	- Automated CI and CD
	- Repository Maintenance (GitHub)

8. Deployment Strategy:
	- Manuscript draft for research publication (markdown)
